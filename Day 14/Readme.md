# Creating Cancelable Functions in JavaScript

## Code Breakdown

Key functions:

- cancellable(fn, args, t):
  - Takes a function (fn), its arguments (args), and a timeout (t).
  - Returns a new function that can be canceled.
- setTimeout(cancelFn, cancelTimeMs):
  - Schedules the cancelable function (cancelFn) to execute after a delay.

## Real-World Examples

Common use cases for cancelable functions:
