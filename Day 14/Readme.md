# Creating Cancelable Functions in JavaScript

This repository demonstrates a simple pattern for creating cancelable functions in JavaScript.

## Code Breakdown

Key functions:

    cancellable(fn, args, t):
        Takes a function (fn), its arguments (args), and a timeout (t).
        Returns a new function that can be canceled.
    setTimeout(cancelFn, cancelTimeMs):
        Schedules the cancelable function (cancelFn) to execute after a delay.

## Real-World Examples

Common use cases for cancelable functions:

    Delayed User Input Validation
    Asynchronous Data Fetching with Cancelability
    Timeout-Based Operations with Early Termination
    UI Interactions with Cancelable Animations or Effects
